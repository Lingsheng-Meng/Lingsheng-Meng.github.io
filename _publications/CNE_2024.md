Abstract:
The parsing of rich spatiotemporal information to guide decision-making is a hallmark of biological systems. However, the mechanisms behind how biological sensors process vast amounts of information remain poorly understood. A broad class of animals rely on touch sensation for guidance. Among these, the American cockroach P. americana uses a pair of soft antennae for tactile exploration. With approximately 40,000 sensilla distributed along ~150 segments, the American cockroach uses its antennae to orient in the wind, discriminate surface texture by active touch, localize objects to orient in space, etc. We hypothesize that soft antenna mechanics and sensilla properties are tuned to break down tactile features into a lexicon of spatiotemporal patterns (motifs) that form a sparse set. To test this hypothesis, we developed a neuro-mechanical model of the antenna. The mechanical model consists of a sequence of rigid links interconnected by hinge joints. We simulated the mechanical response of the antenna using the MuJoCo physics engine and demonstrated the modelâ€™s high fidelity to the actual antenna. We integrated our mechanical model with a neuronal model of antenna sensors to predict individual and populational neural responses to touch. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we identified that sensor mechanical properties and contact speed influence feature classification. Overall, our neuromechanical model reveals how antenna mechanics represent a diverse set of tactile features into a lexicon of motifs. These motifs may assist in decision-making during slower tactile exploration and rapid course control. Our model is inspiring a soft, distributed robotic sensor.   
This poster is about developing a neuro-mechanical model of a soft, distributed insect sensor.
