Insect antennae are distributed biological sensors that provide rich spatial and temporal multimodal information about the surrounding environment, enabling informed decision making even in poorly lit conditions. While high-fidelity tactile perception is common in insects, there is no engineering analogue for insect-scale robots due in part to their low weight and power budgets, placing strict limits on their capacity for autonomous navigation. The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) antenna-with its approximately 140 strain sensing segments making up the passive flagellum-is one such example of a highly integrated and distributed mechanosensory system enabling tactile navigation with low overhead in weight and energy consumption. Inspired by this highly capable biological system, we have designed a near scale (40x4mm) modular eight element robophysical antenna prototype with integrated sliding capacitive sensing and readout electronics that are capable of measuring deflection (~1um resolution) along the its length with high accuracy and speed (~1 KHz, 2 mrad). The antenna is constructed using the stack laminate approach, which has been successfully applied to actuators, sensors, and hinges in a variety of millimeter scale systems. This model will ideally enable biologists to validate mechanical principles governing tactile sensing and roboticists to achieve autonomous touch-based navigation at the insect scale.
