Education
======
* B.E. in Vehicle Engineering, Tsinghua University, 2019
* Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, 2026 (expected)

Research experience
======
* [**Cockroach Antenna Tactile Signal Processing**](https://lingsheng-meng.github.io/research/research-1) \| Penn State
  * Jan.2023 - present: Research Assistant (ongoing Thesis)
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jean-Michel Mongeau](https://sites.psu.edu/mongeau/PIbio/)
    * Obtained precise mechanical sensilla distribution in the antenna through a comprehensive review of literature, micro-CT, and SEM scanning. Segmented the 3D structure of strain sensilla from micro-CT data.
    * Developed a model of the antenna to link tactile features to distinct patterns on soft sensors using the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) physics engine.

* **Fly Behavior Analysis for Wing Damage Compensation during Flight** \| Penn State
  * Sept.2022 - Dec.2022: Research Assistant
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jean-Michel Mongeau](https://sites.psu.edu/mongeau/PIbio/)
    * Acquired and analyzed 11 experimental datasets on wing damage in rigid tethered flies during flight, with a focus on studying wingbeat frequency changes following perturbations.
    * Performed 3D flight behavior reconstruction for 10 flies to derive wing Euler angles, using a custom 3D reconstruction software. These tasks assisted lab senior Dr.[Wael Salem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wael-salem/) in his [dissertation](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/19881was29).

* [**Flyâ€™s Neuronal Activity Experiment Setup using Two-Photon Microscopy**](https://lingsheng-meng.github.io/design/design-1) \| Penn State
  * May 2022 - Aug.2022: Research Assistant
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jean-Michel Mongeau](https://sites.psu.edu/mongeau/PIbio/)
    * Designed adjustable-angle mounting for the semicylinder LED arena and a temperature control saline system for the fly holder in the two-photon microscopy area.

* [**Reconstructing Pediatric-Fall Induced Head Injuries**](https://lingsheng-meng.github.io/research/research-0) \| University of Michigan
  * Aug.2019 - Dec.2019: Research Assistant
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jingwen Hu](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/jingwenhu/home)
    * Utilized [Mimics](https://www.materialise.com/en/healthcare/mimics-innovation-suite/mimics) software to generate 3 subject-specific CT-derived geometric models and finite element models.
    * Employed 29 reconstructed investigative fall data to derive injury predictive parameters using FEA in [LS-DYNA (Ansys)](https://www.ansys.com/products/structures/ansys-ls-dyna).
    * Published a conference paper in [IRCOBI 2020](http://www.ircobi.org/wordpress/downloads/irc20-asia/pdf-files/2046a.pdf) as the second author.

* [**Design for in-wheel Motor Based Electric Wheels**](https://lingsheng-meng.github.io/research/research-0) \| Tsinghua University
  * Dec.2017 - Aug.2019: Main Group Member
  * Supervisor: Professor [Zhichao Hou](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085377720)
    * Designed innovative in-wheel driving electric wheel prototype for electric vehicles.
    * Submitted patent applications for 10 novel concepts ([9 Chinese patents and 1 PCT patent](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=%E5%AD%9F%E4%BB%A4%E7%9B%9B)).
    * Developed 3 physical prototypes of the designed electric wheel, which were entered into prestigious competitions, including Tsinghua University (Apr. 2018), Beijing (May. 2019), and the [National (Nov. 2019)](http://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/12/1543.html) Challenge Cup. Achieved special awards (2%, 3%, 1%, respectively) in all competitions.
    * Published as the first author in both SAECCE 2019 conference proceedings and the [Journal of Automobile Engineering](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954407020921736).
