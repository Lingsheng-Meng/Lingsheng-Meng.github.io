Education
======
* B.E. in Vehicle Engineering, Tsinghua University, 2019
* Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, 2026 (expected)

Research experience
======
* [__Cockroach Antenna Tactile Signal Processing__](https://lingsheng-meng.github.io/research/research-1) \| Penn State
  * Jan.2023 - present: Research Assistant (ongoing Thesis)
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jean-Michel Mongeau](https://sites.psu.edu/mongeau/PIbio/)
    * Obtained precise mechanical sensilla distribution in the antenna through a comprehensive review of literature, micro-CT, and SEM scanning. Segmented the 3D structure of strain sensilla from micro-CT data.
    * Developed a model of the antenna to link tactile features to distinct patterns on soft sensors using the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) physics engine.

* **Fly Behavior Analysis for Wing Damage Compensation during Flight** \| Penn State
  * Sept.2022 - Dec.2022: Research Assistant
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jean-Michel Mongeau](https://sites.psu.edu/mongeau/PIbio/)
    * Acquired and analyzed 6 experimental datasets on wing damage in rigid tethered flies during flight, with a focus on studying wingbeat frequency changes following perturbations.
    * Performed 3D flight behavior reconstruction for 10 flies to derive wing Euler angles, using a custom 3D reconstruction software. These tasks assisted lab senior Dr.[Wael Salem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wael-salem/) in his [dissertation](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/19881was29).

* **Flyâ€™s Neuronal Activity Experiment Setup using Two-Photon Microscopy** \| Penn State
  * May 2022 - Aug.2022: Research Assistant
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jean-Michel Mongeau](https://sites.psu.edu/mongeau/PIbio/)
    * Designed adjustable-angle mounting for the semicylinder LED arena and a temperature control saline system for the fly holder in the two-photon microscopy area.

* **Reconstructing Pediatric-Fall Induced Head Injuries** \| University of Michigan
  * Aug. 2019 - Dec.2019: Research Assistant
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jingwen Hu](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/jingwenhu/home)
    * Utilized [Mimics](https://www.materialise.com/en/healthcare/mimics-innovation-suite/mimics) software to generate 3 subject-specific CT-derived geometric models and finite element models.
    * Employed 29 reconstructed investigative fall data to derive injury predictive parameters using FEA in [LS-DYNA (Ansys)](https://www.ansys.com/products/structures/ansys-ls-dyna).
    * Published a conference paper in [IRCOBI 2020](http://www.ircobi.org/wordpress/downloads/irc20-asia/pdf-files/2046a.pdf) as the second author.

Work experience
