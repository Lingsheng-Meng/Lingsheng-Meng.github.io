Education
======
* B.E. in Vehicle Engineering, Tsinghua University, 2019
* Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, 2026 (expected)

Research experience
======
* **Cockroach Antenna Tactile Signal Processing**
  * Jan.2023 - present: Research Assistant (ongoing Thesis)
  * Penn State
  * Supervisor: Professor Jean-Michel Mongeau
    * Obtained precise mechanical sensilla distribution in the antenna through a comprehensive review of literature, micro-CT, and SEM scanning. Segmented the 3D structure of strain sensilla from micro-CT data.
    * Developed a model of the antenna to link tactile features to distinct patterns on soft sensors using the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) physics engine.
