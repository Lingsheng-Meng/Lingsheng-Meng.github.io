Education
======
* B.E. in Vehicle Engineering, Tsinghua University, 2019
* Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, 2026 (expected)

Research experience
======
* <div style="text-align: left;">**Cockroach Antenna Tactile Signal Processing**</div><div style="text-align: right;">Penn State</div>
  * Jan.2023 - present: Research Assistant (ongoing Thesis)
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jean-Michel Mongeau](https://sites.psu.edu/mongeau/PIbio/)
    * Obtained precise mechanical sensilla distribution in the antenna through a comprehensive review of literature, micro-CT, and SEM scanning. Segmented the 3D structure of strain sensilla from micro-CT data.
    * Developed a model of the antenna to link tactile features to distinct patterns on soft sensors using the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) physics engine.

* **Fly behavior Analysis for Wing Damage Compensation during Flight** | Penn State
  * Sept.2022 - Dec.2022: Research Assistant
  * Supervisor: Professor [Jean-Michel Mongeau](https://sites.psu.edu/mongeau/PIbio/)
    * Acquired and analyzed 6 experimental datasets on wing damage in rigid tethered flies during flight, with a focus on studying wingbeat frequency changes following perturbations.
    * Performed 3D flight behavior reconstruction for 10 flies to derive wing Euler angles, using a custom 3D reconstruction software. These tasks assisted lab senior Dr.[Wael Salem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wael-salem/) in his [dissertation](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/19881was29).

Work experience
======
* Summer 2018: Assistant Engineer
  * [Dongfeng Motor Corporation Technical Center](http://www.dongfeng-global.com/)
    * Helped with the Kinematics and compliance (K&C) testing for prototype cars.
    * Conducted statistical analysis on data obtained from bounce test, roll test, lateral and longitudinal compliance tests
