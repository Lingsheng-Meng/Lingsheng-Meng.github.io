I presented a talk today at SICB (Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology) 2026 in Portland, OR.  

My talk, titled "Spike-based classification of tactile features with an insect-inspired antenna neuromechanical model", explored how a neuromechanical model of antenna can improve the understanding of tactile discrimination of insect. 

Portland is also a fun city. I really love the Japanese vibe there
