## 🪶 Mechanics of the Cockroach Antenna

During my PhD research, I study the biomechanics of the American cockroach antenna to understand how morphology and material properties shape tactile sensing. This work combines **biological experiments, Micro-CT imaging, 3D reconstruction, and finite element modeling (FEM)** to reveal how antenna structure supports sensory function.  

---

### 🔹 Research Focus
- Investigated **mechanical behavior and morphology** of antenna annuli using experiments and imaging.  
- Built **3D reconstructions from Micro-CT** to capture annulus-level structure.  
- Developed **finite element models** to simulate bending mechanics and strain transmission.  
- Tested the **kinematic chain model** hypothesis, showing annuli are linked by softer joints.  
- Explored how **mechanical specializations** (e.g., tip-region folding structures) confer flexibility and prevent buckling.  

---

### 🔹 Key Innovations
- Demonstrated that the **antenna flagellum behaves as a kinematic chain**, supporting distributed flexibility.  
- Identified a **unique folding structure at the tip annuli**, allowing large bending without failure.  
- Used FEM to **map strain at mechanosensory locations (campaniform sensilla)**, linking mechanics to sensory encoding.  
- Provided a **mechanistic framework** for how insect antennae convert touch forces into proprioceptive signals.

### 🔹 Achievements
- **Preprint**: [bioRxiv, 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.07.647640v1)  
- **Journal Submission**: *Journal of Experimental Biology* (in 2nd round of revision)  
- **Manuscript Title**: *Mechanical and morphological features of the filiform antenna support a kinematic chain system, confer flexibility and predict strain for proprioception*  
- Advanced understanding of **biomechanical adaptations in insect tactile sensing**, bridging biology, mechanics, and modeling.
