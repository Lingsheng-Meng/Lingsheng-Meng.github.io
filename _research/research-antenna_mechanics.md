title: "Biomechanics of Insect Antenna"
excerpt: "This project investigates how the structure and material properties of insect antenna shape tactile sensing. Through **experiments, Micro-CT imaging, 3D reconstruction, and finite element modeling**, I showed that the antenna flagellum functions as a kinematic chain system with regional specializations that enhance flexibility and prevent buckling. These findings provide a mechanistic framework linking antenna mechanics to proprioceptive strain sensing.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

## Mechanics of Insect Antenna

During my PhD research, I study the biomechanics of insect antenna to understand how morphology and material properties shape tactile sensing. This work combines **biological experiments, Micro-CT imaging, 3D reconstruction, and finite element modeling (FEM)** to reveal how antenna structure supports sensory function.

### ðŸ”¹ Research Focus
- Investigated **mechanical behavior and morphology** of antenna annuli using experiments and imaging.  
- Built **3D reconstructions from Micro-CT** to capture annulus-level structure.  
- Developed **finite element models** to simulate bending mechanics and strain transmission.  
- Tested the **kinematic chain model** hypothesis, showing annuli are linked by softer joints.  
- Explored how **mechanical specializations** (e.g., tip-region folding structures) confer flexibility and prevent buckling.
