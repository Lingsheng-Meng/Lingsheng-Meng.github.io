## ðŸ§  Neuro-Mechanical Computational Model of Insect Antennae  

This project develops a **neuro-mechanical model of the cockroach antenna** to study how mechanical signals from antennal deflections are transformed into neural activity for tactile feature perception. By coupling physics-based simulations with neural encoding models and electrophysiology experiments, I showed how antenna mechanics shape sparse, spike-based neural codes that enable efficient feature classification.

### ðŸ”¹ Research Focus
- Modeled antenna mechanics as a **multi-joint kinematic chain** within a physics-based simulation environment (**MuJoCo**).  
- Derived **spatiotemporal strain patterns (tactile tensors)** from antennal deflections under different contact conditions.  
- Developed phenomenological models of **campaniform and hair sensilla** to encode mechanical strain into spike trains.  
- Validated model predictions against **extracellular recordings** from cockroach antennal nerves.  
- Trained **spiking neural networks (SNNs)** on simulated spike trains to classify tactile features.
