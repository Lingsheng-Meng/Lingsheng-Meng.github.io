## Fly Behavior Analysis for Wing Damage Compensation during Flight

As a new PhD student in the Mongeau Lab, I learned to operate the **3D wing motion recording system** with laser-triggered capture and gained experience in using **custom software for 3D reconstruction of wing kinematics**. I assisted senior PhD student Dr. [Wael Salem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wael-salem/) with experiments and data analysis, contributing to his [dissertation](https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/19881was29) on insect flight biomechanics.

### ðŸ”¹ Research Focus
- Investigated how **wing damage affects flight control** in tethered flies.  
- Analyzed **wingbeat frequency changes** following mechanical perturbations.  
- Assisted in uncovering compensatory mechanisms underlying stable flight despite wing asymmetry.
