As a student intern, I have been involved in addressing the critical issue of pediatric head/brain injuries research supported by National Institute of Justice (NIJ). These injuries are a primary cause of pediatric mortality, disability, and healthcare expenses. Unfortunately, there is a significant lack of anthropometric and mechanical response data specific to pediatric heads.
