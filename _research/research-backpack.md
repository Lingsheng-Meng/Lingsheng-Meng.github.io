## Wireless Neural Recording and Stimulation in Freely Moving Cockroaches 🪳  

This project integrates **wireless neurotechnology** with insect behavioral experiments to understand how neural activity drives complex behaviors in freely moving cockroaches. In collaboration with CU Boulder, we developed a **lightweight (2.2 g) electrophysiology backpack** featuring an **Intan neural recording**, **stimulation chip**, **Bluetooth communication**, and an **onboard camera** for behavioral monitoring.

### 🔹 Research Focus
- Studied **neural control of escape and antennal behaviors** using electrical stimulation of the brain (AMMC) region.  
- Investigated how **stimulation intensity** modulates behavioral escape (shock) responses.
- Observed **antenna-specific responses** during low-voltage stimulation, suggesting localized sensory feedback.  
- Implemented **neural recording electrodes** in the brain to monitor neural activity during **freely behaving cockroach experiments**.  
- Found preliminary correlations between **neural activity** and **hissing behavior** in Madagascar cockroach.
