## ðŸš— Novel In-Wheel Motor Electric Wheel Design
- During my undergraduate studies at Tsinghua University, I collaborated with my classmates and best friends, [Yudi Qin](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088939544) and [Yuanji Zou](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089476688), on a research project developing next-generation in-wheel motor technology to improve vehicle dynamics, vibration performance, and system integration. As a core member of the team, I contributed to the design, vibration analysis, and system-level optimization. This joint work was recognized at the national level and became one of the most unforgettable and rewarding experiences of my college years.

### ðŸ”¹ Research Focus
- Proposed a new **vibro-dynamic configuration** that introduced additional degrees of freedom and optimized modal characteristics.  
- Designed a **two-stage suspension in-wheel motor architecture** to overcome the major challenge of vibration amplification (0.5â€“25 Hz) in conventional hub motors.  
- Developed **system-level evaluation metrics** and applied **multi-objective optimization algorithms** to balance ride comfort, safety, and energy efficiency.  
- Built prototypes, conducted **bench testing**, and validated through **CarSimâ€“Simulink simulations**, demonstrating >70% reduction in motor/body vibration compared to conventional designs.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Innovations
- **Two-stage suspension structure** inside the hub motor, significantly reducing vibration transmission.  
- **Integrated flexible transmission mechanism** for compact, lightweight, and cost-effective design.  
- **System-level optimization platform** for rapid parameter matching across different vehicle types.  
- **Distributed drive control algorithms** improving energy efficiency (>10%) and enabling advanced maneuvers (on-spot turning, lateral movement, obstacle crossing).

### ðŸ”¹ Achievements
- **Patents**: 10 patent applications (9 Chinese patents, 1 PCT international patent).  
- **Publications**: 1 paper ([Proc. IMechE Part D: J. Automobile Engineering, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954407020921736)) and 1 conference paper.  
- **Competitions**:  
  - *Tsinghua University Challenge Cup (2018)* â€“ Special Award (Top 2%)  
  - *Beijing Challenge Cup (2019)* â€“ Special Award (Top 3%)  
  - *National Challenge Cup (2019)* â€“ Special Award (Top 1%)
