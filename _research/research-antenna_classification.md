title: "Biomechanics of Insect Antenna"
excerpt: "This project investigates how the structure and material properties of insect antenna shape tactile sensing. Through **experiments, Micro-CT imaging, 3D reconstruction, and finite element modeling**, I showed that the antenna flagellum functions as a kinematic chain system with regional specializations that enhance flexibility and prevent buckling. These findings provide a mechanistic framework linking antenna mechanics to proprioceptive strain sensing.<br/><img src='/images/antenna_mechanics.jpg' width='80%'>"

## Physically Intelligent Insect-Inspired Antennae for Tactile Perception  

This project investigates how **insect-inspired physical intelligence** can improve robotic tactile sensing. By mimicking the mechanical gradients and active sensing strategies of cockroach antennae, I demonstrated how morphology and dynamics can simplify tactile classification and reduce computational demands in robotics.
