## Physically Intelligent Insect-Inspired Antennae for Tactile Perception  

This project investigates how **insect-inspired physical intelligence** can improve robotic tactile sensing. By mimicking the mechanical gradients and active sensing strategies of cockroach antennae, I demonstrated how morphology and dynamics can simplify tactile classification and reduce computational demands in robotics.
