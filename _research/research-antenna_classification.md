## Physically Intelligent Insect-Inspired Antennae for Tactile Perception  

This project investigates how **insect-inspired physical intelligence** can improve robotic tactile sensing. By mimicking the mechanical gradients and active sensing strategies of cockroach antennae, I demonstrated how morphology and dynamics can simplify tactile classification and reduce computational demands in robotics.

### ðŸ”¹ Research Focus
- Explored how **stiffness gradients** and **contact speeds** in antenna mechanics shape tactile signal processing.  
- Developed **bioinspired computational models in MuJoCo** and **robophysical experiments** based on cockroach antennae.  
- Generated **tactile tensors** (spatiotemporal representations of tactile stimuli) under varied contact conditions.  
- Validated findings through **sim-to-real transfer** on a miniature distributed robotic antenna.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Innovations
- Developed computational models in **MuJoCo**, serving as a *digital twin* of both a biological antenna and a distributed tactile sensor system, enabling studies of biomechanics and guiding robotic sensor design.  
- Demonstrated that **physical intelligence in biological antenna** increases tactile data sparsity and dispersion, improving feature classification.  
- Identified **mechanical gradients and slower contact speeds** as critical for enhancing tactile perception.  
- Developed a **novel tactile tensor framework** to represent and classify tactile scenes.
